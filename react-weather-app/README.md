We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, App will pass callbacks to WeatherSearchForm that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by App will call setState(), and the app will be updated.
